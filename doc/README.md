# Documentation #
This is the setup documentation for the application: start with `server_setup.md`, continue with `app_setup.md`.

## Additional Info ##
There is an example file for Capistrano deployment, if you plan to develop the app further. For more info on Capistrano, see [this page](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano). See `config/deploy.rb` to start using it.
