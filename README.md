# A.T. Usage #

This is the open-sourced repo for my undergraduate fourth year project, which analyzed machine usage in Appleton Tower. The system can be seen in action at [http://project.shearn89.com], which demos how the system works.

Documentation is available in the `/doc` folder.

Stable version of the project can be downloaded here: https://nodeload.github.com/shearn89/at_usage/tarball/v1.1

Clone this repo using `git clone git://github.com/shearn89/at_usage.git`.
